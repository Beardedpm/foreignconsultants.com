    <p><b><font color="#800000" size="2"><a class="link" name="2"></a>What is credential evaluation?</font></b></p>

    education somewhere other than the US and wish to have your credentials 
    understood and accepted on the territory of the US or by the US or other 
    International Employers Worldwide, you must have your Credentials evaluated.</p>
