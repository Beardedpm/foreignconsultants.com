        is Credential Evaluation? </font></b><br>
        <br>
        Credential evaluation means the conversion of foreign academic 
        credentials into their US educational equivalents. FCI produces an 
        individualized report describing each certificate, diploma, or degree 
        you have earned and specifying its approximate US equivalent.<br>
        <br>
        <font color="#333333"><b>What can a Credential Evaluation do for me? </b>
        </font><br>
        <br>
        By converting your educational qualifications into their US equivalents, 
        an evaluation allows academic institutions, prospective employers, INS 
        officials, and other interested parties in the US to understand - and 
        thus better to appreciate and assess - your educational achievements, 
        training, and experience. Our evaluations also provide you with a better 
        understanding of what to expect when you present your educational 
        credentials for study, employment, or immigration to the US. Whether you 
        are pursuing further education, looking for a better job, or applying 
        for a visa, FCI can help you make the most of your foreign education.<br>
        <br>
        FCI can help you get where you want to go faster by evaluating your 
        credentials in terms of their US equivalents. A FCI Evaluation is 
        important…</p>
        <ul>
          <li>if you plan to continue your education in the US</li>
          <li>if you seek professional licensing in the US</li>
          <li>if you seek employment in the US</li>
          <li>if you are applying for certain US immigration visa categories that require credential 
          evaluation and certification of equivalency</li>
        </ul>
        <p><font color="#333333"><b>What 
        is our approach in preparing evaluations? </b></font><br>
        <br>
        In preparing its reports, FCI draws on its extensive library of 
        resources, including archives of annotated syllabi, college catalogues, 
        and previous evaluations, and consults with its network of educational 
        professionals in the US and abroad. Direct contact with foreign 
        educational institutions and government agencies guarantees the most 
        up-to-date information.<br>
        <br>
        Our evaluation reports provide clear and concise statements of 
        educational equivalency for each of your academic credentials, starting 
        with secondary education and continuing through every type of 
        post-secondary education and professional training. The equivalency 
        statements contained in each report derive from commonly accepted 
        standards in the international and comparative education communities. 
        Our evaluation policies are developed in consultation with other experts 
        in the field, and our clients are assured that our reports are based on 
        the most current information available. <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        We make every effort to obtain pertinent data for accurate and equitable 
        assessments. <br>
